Data for the paper "Hyperelliptic Parametrizations of Q-curves"

A Magma file containing all the necessary functions and the computations of the subsection 3.2 of 
the paper "Hyperelliptic Parametrizations of Q-curves", join with Francesc Bars and Josep Gonzalez 

Also a text file containing the list by F.Bars of polynomials associated to j-invariants of
rational points for X_0^*(N) hyperelliptic with N square-free.
